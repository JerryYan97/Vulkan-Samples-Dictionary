Use deferred rendering.

First App that uses the DearImGUI application template.
First App that needs to load a relatively large scene.

I may want to design a materialized input system.

Deploy enough point lights in the scene.
--- Ambient Occlusion only affects ambient light. I may don't need the point lights.

Step 1:
Render out Scene's Diffuse Color.

Step 2:
Add ImGUI on Top of it.

Step 3:
Switch between Diffuse Color and Normal Color

Step 4 ~:
Include SSAO.
